This module will use the BioTech flowmeter or any other flowmeter and report to the telemetry as a Gassuite with 3 values
- Fuel Remaining . You need a lua to program the 0x0D30 value from the script
- Average flow
- Max Flow

The widget will permit to save in the sensor, the tank Capacity and also the Pulses/L depending of the flowmeter.

The Biotech is about 2500 pulses/L, and you need to adjust after few flights

This module can be used with Kingtech Lua Script or using a standard widget value
