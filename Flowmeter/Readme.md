This module will use the BioTech flowmeter or any other flowmeter and report to the telemetry as a Gassuite with 3 values
- Fuel Remaining .
- Average flow
- Max Flow

Don't forget to discover the 2 DIY sensors (5200/ 5201) to use the widget

The widget will permit to save in the sensor, the tank Capacity and also the Pulses/L depending of the flowmeter.

The Biotech is about 2500 pulses/L, and you need to adjust after few flights

This module can be used with Kingtech Lua Script or using a standard widget value
